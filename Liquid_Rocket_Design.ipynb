    "## Propellants\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many liquid propellants that can be used in a rocket motor. The propellant, oxidizer and fuel both are critical to all parts of a liquid rocket engine thus a fuel needs to be desided on first. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, ranging from combustion tempurature, maximum achievable ISP (specific impulse), combustion products and availbility. In this section will be exploring different propellants that are relievent to a first prototype hobbist.\n",

    "Since the goal isn't a flight engine but more a test bed for learning and exploration, a good choice is LOX and Methyl Alcohol. Methyl Alcohol is readily availible and is relitivly cheap. Liquid oxygen isn't the easiest to source, the density of LOX is closer to Methyl alcohol then gasuous oxygen thus simplifying injector design.\n",

    "## Design Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "In any design, before any solidworks is done or any real decisions are made, a mathmatical backbone must be created to prop up the design in some semblence of reality. For Rocket engine engineering, this will include: Finding cross sectional areas given a desired thrust, finding the state variables at critical points in the engine and considering reality of building a liquid rocket engine for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nozzle\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important parts of an engine is the nozzle. This determines the thrust, flow speed, chamber pressure,  expansion of exhaust gas, and the tempurature. Deciding on shape and area will be critical for a functioning engine.\n",

    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although simulating an entire rocket engine with everything from thermochemisty to fluid dynamics is almost impossible for even a large scale manufactorer let alone an amature, specific parts or system would certainly benefit from smaller scale simulations. For instance, once engine size and shape is generally locked in, testing the injector plate would be extremely helpful to see if the design is one the right track. Since the injector is generally only a fluid dynamics problem, simulation could work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem occurs when testing multi phase problems like general engine performance. A rocket engine is at its simpliest, a piston cylinder (with one wall missing), generate pressure (using heat and gas expansion) and convert that pressure into work (by converting that pressure into high velocities). One could create a fairly comprehensive mesh and the general initial conditions of heat,pressure,mass inflow and see how the engine shape fares. The information gained would be flawed because of the massive amount of assumptions need to make a smoothly running simulation but it be information gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A new approach should be considered. That simulation will only be used once all of the knowledge and systems are throughly understood. This will allow for design changes to be made to optimize on already calculated aspects of the design. Simulation is a tool, anyone can learn HOW to use it but it will not be useful if one does not understand WHY one is using it in the first place. \n",

    "## Manufactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufactoring will be a challenge. Especially when The budget isn't that large and the knowledge. An effort must be made to contact and talk to manufactors that have experience with brazing exotic metals, copper to inconel, which by nature is critical to the proper function of the rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although by nature the engineering will dictate how the engine is made but I will list ideas here as a dump so I'm not distracted while designing the rest of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brazenly cool: \n",
    "A machined relatively thin walled copper inner tube is brazed to a stainless steel or inconel jacket. Between the inner and outer jackets are fins that act as a support transfering load from the thin walled copper to the stronger outer jacket.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology as of 5/26/2020:** having a copper inner jacket allows for a higher chamber temperature since the copper can transfer more energy out of the walls. The choice of stainless steel or inconel are the relative strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons as of 5/26/2020:** depending on the heat transfer rate and pressure of the chamber, machining of the copper could be extremely difficult. The entire assembly (at it simpliest) must be brazed together and would be very challenging plus might result in assembly failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One button:\n",
    "A optimized design would be 3d printed out of stainless steel."
