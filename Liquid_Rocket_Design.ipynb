    "There are many liquid propellants that can be used in a rocket motor. The propellant, oxidizer and fuel both are critical to all parts of a liquid rocket engine thus a fuel needs to be desided on first. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, ranging from combustion tempurature, maximum achievable ISP (specific impulse), combustion products and availbility. In this section will be exploring different propellants that are relievent to a first prototype hobbist.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although simulating an entire rocket engine with everything from thermochemisty to fluid dynamics is almost impossible for even a large scale manufactorer let alone an amature, specific parts or system would certainly benefit from smaller scale simulations. For instance, once engine size and shape is generally locked in, testing the injector plate would be extremely helpful to see if the design is one the right track. Since the injector is generally only a fluid dynamics problem, simulation could work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem occurs when testing multi phase problems like general engine performance. A rocket engine is at its simpliest, a piston cylinder (with one wall missing), generate pressure (using heat and gas expansion) and convert that pressure into work (by converting that pressure into high velocities). One could create a fairly comprehensive mesh and the general initial conditions of heat,pressure,mass inflow and see how the engine shape fares. The information gained would be flawed because of the massive amount of assumptions need to make a smoothly running simulation but it be information gained.\n",
