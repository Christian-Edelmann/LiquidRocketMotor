Liquid Rocket Engines


One part out me has always wanted to build my own rocket motor. So this is all
here so I can design one. This isn't an express plan but more to satisfy my own
curiosity on what actually goes into design one of these marvels of modern
engineering. The intent is to go from mathematics and theory all the way to a cad
model with build instructions and to document the whole process.

This is a "off hours" project so development will be slow. I do intent on including
simulations and new tools for me to learn and become a better engineer.

The jupyter notebook will store the day to day information and discoveries to keep
track and later will be transformed into a paper.

Update Notes

5/27/2020 - The notebook progress is going well. I'm mostly just putting me ideas
down as a log and so I don't need to think/stress about them (ie i can revisit
them). I updated the manufacturing ideas and added notes that it is all
preliminary and speculative. I added to some of the propellant section discussing
the reaction balance and the corresponding ratios that would result.

5/28/2020 - Started a lot of the compressible flow dynamics. Its slow going and I
need to find more worked out example of going through the math. I might also consider
reviewing incompressible flow as well. I also need to figure out how to integrate
the thermodynamics into the fluid calculations.

6/5/2020 - After a lot of reading, I am starting to understand how the fluid
mechanics of a convergent divergent nozzle works. I will finish up the learning
aspect of it and start to work towards implimenting the equations and creating
the geometry of the nozzle its self. I think I'm going to try and create a script
that will do the math based on the input assumptions like pressure and mass inflow
rate. I will need to also learn how to use pandas so I can output a cvs/txt file
that I will be able to do my CFD analysis and the solidworks design. I would also
like to have the solidworks design linked to that file so if I change the
underlying assumptions the design will evolve with it. SO basically here comes the
hard part.
