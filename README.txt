Liquid Rocket Engines


One part out me has always wanted to build my own rocket motor. So this is all
here so I can design one. This isn't an express plan but more to satisfy my own
curiousity on what actually goes into design one of these marvels of modern
engineering. The intent is to go from mathematics and theory all the way to a cad
model with build instructions and to document the whole process.

This is a "off hours" project so development will be slow. I do intent on including
simulations and new tools for me to learn and become a better engineer.

The jupyter notebook will store the day to day information and discoveries to keep
track and later will be transformed into a paper.
