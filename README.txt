Liquid Rocket Engines


One part out me has always wanted to build my own rocket motor. So this is all
here so I can design one. This isn't an express plan but more to satisfy my own
curiosity on what actually goes into design one of these marvels of modern
engineering. The intent is to go from mathematics and theory all the way to a cad
model with build instructions and to document the whole process.

This is a "off hours" project so development will be slow. I do intent on including
simulations and new tools for me to learn and become a better engineer.

The jupyter notebook will store the day to day information and discoveries to keep
track and later will be transformed into a paper.

Update Notes

5/27/2020 - The notebook progress is going well. I'm mostly just putting me ideas
down as a log and so I don't need to think/stress about them (ie i can revisit
them). I updated the manufacturing ideas and added notes that it is all
preliminary and speculative. I added to some of the propellant section discussing
the reaction balance and the corresponding ratios that would result.
